The [Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) is the Ethereum Foundation's official way to deposit your ETH for staking on Ethereum

    - [React](https://reactjs.org/) via [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
    - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Development workflow

By default, `dev` acts as the primary base branch which all PRs should merge into. Make sure any pull requests target this branch.

## Launchpad deployment

- The `master` branch represents the live **testnet** version of the Launchpad. Open a PR to merge `dev` into `master` to deploy a testnet Launchpad (e.g. [#517](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-launchpad/pull/517) for https://holesky.launchpad.ethereum.org/ )
- The `mainnet` branch represents the live **Mainnet** version of the Launchpad. Open a PR to merge `master` into `mainnet` to deploy the Mainnet Launchpad (e.g. [#518](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-launchpad/pull/518) for https://launchpad.ethereum.org/)

## Launchpad translation

As part of the [ethereum.org Translation Program](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program), our community of translators is also working on translating the Ethereum Staking Launchpad.

If you are interested in getting involved and helping with the translations, please [visit the project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/launchpad-translation). 

After joining the project, you can start translating by opening your desired language from the language list. If your language isn't available, please reach out to Ethereum.org Team on Crowdin or [open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-launchpad/issues/new) to request adding a new language for translation.

Detailed information on using Crowdin is available in the [Crowdin Online Editor documentation](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/).
